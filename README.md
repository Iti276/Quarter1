# Quarter 1

## Subjects:
1. Analytics With R
2. Probability Theory and Statistics

## Projects:
1. Drugs Analytics
2. HIV Analytics

## Overview:
This README file provides an overview of the courses and projects completed during Quarter 1 at university. Both subjects revolved around the application of statistical analysis and probability theory, with a focus on using the R programming language for implementation.

## Subjects:

### 1. Analytics With R:
- **Description:** This course delved into the fundamentals of analytics using the R programming language. It covered various statistical techniques and data analysis methodologies.
- **Topics Covered:** Descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, data visualization, and more.
- **Achievements:** Successfully completed all assignments, quizzes, and exams. Developed proficiency in using R for data analysis tasks.

### 2. Probability Theory and Statistics:
- **Description:** This course provided a comprehensive understanding of probability theory and statistical methods. It explored concepts such as probability distributions, random variables, sampling distributions, and hypothesis testing.
- **Topics Covered:** Probability distributions (binomial, normal, Poisson, etc.), central limit theorem, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, Bayesian statistics, etc.
- **Achievements:** Demonstrated a strong grasp of theoretical concepts and their practical applications. Completed assignments and exams with a solid understanding of probability theory and statistics principles.

## Projects:

### 1. Drugs Analytics:
- **Description:** The Drugs Analytics project involved analyzing data related to drug usage trends, effects, and demographics using R.
- **Tasks:** Cleaning and preprocessing data, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, building predictive models, and generating insights.
- **Achievements:** Successfully completed the project, showcasing proficiency in data analysis techniques and R programming skills. Presented insightful findings and recommendations based on the analysis.

### 2. HIV Analytics:
- **Description:** The HIV Analytics project focused on analyzing data related to HIV incidence, prevalence, risk factors, and geographic distribution using R.
- **Tasks:** Data cleaning and preprocessing, statistical analysis, spatial analysis, visualization of trends, and pattern recognition.
- **Achievements:** Completed the project with thorough analysis and interpretation of HIV-related data. Utilized advanced statistical techniques and R programming capabilities to derive meaningful insights and conclusions.

## Tools Used:
- R programming language
- RStudio (Integrated Development Environment for R)

## Conclusion:
Quarter 1 was an enriching academic period, where I gained valuable insights and practical skills in analytics, probability theory, and statistics using the R programming language. The completion of both subjects and projects has enhanced my proficiency in data analysis techniques and solidified my understanding of statistical principles.
